# CS-211-Computer-Architecture
These are some of the projects I did while taking Computer Architecture (CS 211) during my spring semester of sophomore year of college. All projects are completed in C. Third project is an Assembly debugger project.

Description of each project:

  1. Assignment I (6 small C programs)
      - Roman
        - Program **roman** which converts numbers from decimal notation into Roman numerals. roman takes a single argument, a string                   containing a non-negative integer, and prints its Roman numeral equivalent to standard output.
      - Palindrome
        - Program **palindrome** that tests whether a string is a palindrome, meaning that the sequence of letters is symmetric and is not               changed by reversal. palindrome takes a single argument, which is a string containing any combination of upper- and lower-case             letters, digits, and punctuation marks. palindrome prints “yes” if its string is a palindrome, and “no” otherwise.
      - Run-length Encoding
        - Program **rle** that uses a simple method to compress strings. Rle takes a single argument and looks for repeated characters. Each             repeated sequence of a letter or punctuation mark is reduced to a single character plus an integer indicating the number of               times it occurs. Thus, “aaa” becomes “a3” and “ab” becomes “a1b1”. 
        - If the compressed string is longer than the original string, rle must print the original string instead. 
        - If the input string contains digits, rle MUST print “error” and nothing else.
      - Linked Lists
        - Program **list** that maintains and manipulates a sorted linked list according to instructions received from standard input.
        - The linked list is maintained in order, meaning that the items in the list are stored in increasing numeric order after every           operation.
      - Matrix Manipulation
        - Program **mexp** that multiplies a square matrix by itself a speciﬁed number of times. mexp takes a single argument, which is the           path to a ﬁle containing a square **(k×k)** matrix **M** and a non-negative exponent **n**. It computes M^n and prints the               result. 
      - Binary Search Trees
        - Program **bst** that manipulates binary search trees. It will receive commands from standard input, and print resposes to those             commands to standard output.
