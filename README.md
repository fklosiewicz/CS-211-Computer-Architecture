# CS-211-Computer-Architecture
These are some of the projects I did while taking Computer Architecture (CS 211) during my spring semester of sophomore year of college. All projects are completed in C. Third project is an Assembly debugger project.

Description of each project:

  1. Big Integer
      - A command line interface program to parse, add, subtract, and multiply integers larger than can be stored in the int datatype.
      - BigTest and DigitNode classes had been provided. 
  2. Trie
      - A command line program to take words in a text file and generate a prefix-trie. 
      - Also implemented trie-search to search for words fulfilling a prefix in the trie.    
      - TrieApp and TrieNode classes had been provided.
  3. Expression Evaluator
      - Designed a command line Java program using recursion and the stack data structure to evaluate arithmetic expressions entered             directly as a string by the user input. 
      - The program allows for swift computation of mathematical expressions using a variety of different operators, whose mathematical         precedence is determined by their position in the implemented stacks.
      - Apart from the Expression class, driver and stack code was provided.
  4. Friends
      - Designed a Java program to take in a text file with data formatted to the described person relationships, and construct a                graphical representation of them. 
      - Using breadth-first search and depth-first search traversal algorithms, the program allows for:
        - Searching of “cliques” or islands of friends 
        - Shortest chains between two people
        - "Connectors” or individuals who, when removed from the graph, cause other individuals to be separated entirely from                      another side of the graph.   
      - Apart from the Friends class, driver and node code was provided.
